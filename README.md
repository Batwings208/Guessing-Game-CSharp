# Guessing-Game-CSharp
This is a guessing game that I made with the help of CSharp. Its a very fun console/terminal game to play if your bored and just want to do something. This took me around 30 minutes to make but it took so long because I was trying many things and I found this to be the easiest version which is simple and not to difficult to understand. You are welcome to use my code to play or even improve it as long as you give me some sort of credit.

Have fun, Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
